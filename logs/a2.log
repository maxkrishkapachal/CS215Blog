Submission Details:
1. index.html - created by Max
    This is the front page of our forum, BaseCamp, where the user can login or sign up. It also 
    shows the top five most recent posts, but the user is unable to click on them unless they're 
    logged in. Currently it has placeholder data to show what it would look like.
	
2. homePage.html - created by Max
    This is the front page of our forum once the user is logged in. It shows the top twenty most
    recent posts from all users. Currently it has placeholder data to show what it would look like.
	
3. signup.html - created by Dmytro
	This is the page where the user can sign up to create an account. It asks for first name, last
    name, email, date of birth, avatar, username, password. Clicking signup will take them to the
    logged in page.

4. managePost.html - created by Dmytro
    This is the page to manage all of the current user's posts. They are listed in their entirety

    of the page to leave a comment. Currently, all posts lead to the same example placeholder post.
